# Movie Database

I made this site as a project from Digital Nation's Genera»õia Tech mentorship program.

It is a simple movie database that contains basic information about movies and allows users to rate
them. It also features a search form to make it easier to find movies.

## How to run

- Have a web server set up with PHP (I used XAMPP). Make sure to also have a MySQL database (needed to
  store user ratings).
- Clone this repo and place it in your server's public folder.
- Access it from a web browser.
