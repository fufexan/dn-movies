# Movie Database

I made this site as a project from Digital Nation's Genera»õia Tech mentorship
program.

It is a simple movie database that contains basic information about movies and
allows users to rate them. It also features a search form to make it easier to
find movies.

Everything is home-baked and the only drawback is the lack of some of the
posters.

## How to run

You will need a few things before starting

1. Have a web server set up with PHP.
2. A MySQL database running on the same machine as the web server. A database
   named `movies_ratings` and a user `php_user` with no password with the following
   privileges: `SELECT`, `INSERT` and `CREATE`.
3. Clone this repo and place it in your server's public folder.
4. Access it from a web browser.
